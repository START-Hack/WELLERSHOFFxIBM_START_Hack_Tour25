# <p align="center"> Financial News detection: From Raw News to Actionable Insights </p>

## <p align="center"> Who are we? </p>
We an independent Zurich-based consultancy specializing in macroeconomic research and capital market insights. We support banks, asset managers, and institutional investors with unbiased analysis and strategy development to turn economic trends into actionable investment decisions.

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>
__Problem:__
To build a clear financial perspective, W&P analysts and strategists must constantly scan global news for events that can move the markets (also news that are relevant for client’s portfolios). If significant developments occur, strategic adjustments must be made and communicated to clients. This process is resource-intensive and risks missing critical developments.
 
__Goal:__
Develop a prototype that automatically identifies news relevant to financial markets (e.g., Fed decisions, CEO exits, earnings surprises), summarizes them, and prepares them for human-in-the-loop review at W&P before delivery to clients.
 
__Audience:__
End users are W&P analysts that turn this information to ad hoc communication for clients (exp. CIOs of a bank who must brief advisors quickly and accurately or adapt the portfolio accordingly).


## <p align="center"> Data </p>
- Publicly available financial news portals, earnings reports (no macro figures)
- (Optional) APIs to financial news aggregators.
- W&P brand assets and sample guidelines for tone and style.
- No proprietary datasets needed for the hackathon stage.


## <p align="center"> Technology </p>

- Web scraping / news APIs.
- NLP models for classification and summarization.
- Optional: alerting systems (browser-based or via messaging).
- Hackathon teams free to choose stack; W&P provides guidelines and sample inputs.
- Python

## <p align="center"> Use Case </p>
__Use Case:__

The bot acts as an early-warning system:
- Detects relevant news.
- Flags and summarizes it.
- Provides context (why it matters).
- Delivers draft text for W&P human review.
 
__Business Case:__

Saves analysts’ time, increases client responsiveness, and strengthens W&P’s role as trusted interpreter.
