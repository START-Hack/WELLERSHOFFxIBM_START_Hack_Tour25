## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>
__Problem:__
## To build a clear financial perspective, W&P analysts and strategists must constantly scan global news for events that can move the markets (also news that are relevant for clientâ€™s portfolios). If significant developments occur, strategic adjustments must be made and communicated to clients. This process is resource-intensive and risks missing critical developments.
 
__Goal:__
Develop a prototype that automatically identifies news relevant to financial markets (e.g., Fed decisions, CEO exits, earnings surprises), summarizes them, and prepares them for human-in-the-loop review at W&P before delivery to clients.
 
__Audience:__
End users are W&P analysts that turn this information to ad hoc communication for clients (exp. CIOs of a bank who must brief advisors quickly and accurately or adapt the portfolio accordingly).
